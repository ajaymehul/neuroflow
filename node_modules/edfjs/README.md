edfjs
=========

A lean javascript implementation of European Data Format.

## Installation

### Build the module locally

Browserify and Minify is used to build the module as a standalone library so that you can import it into your own scripts.
To build, git-clone yourself a local copy of master ``, `cd edfjs`, and
build it with npm using `npm run build`: 

	git clone https://github.com/jusjusjus/edfjs.git
	cd edfjs
	npm install --only=dev
	npm run build

A stand-alone version of the library should appear in `./dist/edf.min.js`.  Before you need to install other -dependencies.

## Usage

[This](https://github.com/jusjusjus/edfjs/blob/master/index.html) gives an example of how to use the library.

See [this webpage](https://jusjusjus.github.io/html/edfdataviewer.html) html snippet for a client-side deployment.

## Tests

  `npm run test`
